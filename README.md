This is one of my first projects, it's a simple CRUD application made just with CRA and SCSS. 
It can either be used locally with localStorage or login with github OAuth which is handled
by the backend (Node.js & MongoDB) at [api.andresmarpz.com](https://github.com/andresmarpz/api.andresmarpz.com). 

The site is hosted statically on a VPS at OVH :).
